<h2> Archaeologist & Writer </h2>
<br>
  <p>
    This is the website of Brazilian archaeologist José Eduardo M. de Medeiros.
    His academic research offers a distinctive perspective on cultural evolution,
    engaging with the historico-genetic theory of culture and making him one of 
    the few Latin American scholars working in this tradition. 
    In addition to his archaeological studies, he conducts ethnographic research 
    on the digitalization of university administration, reflecting on his 
    firsthand experiences in the field. He also publishes fiction 
    and poetry independently. Here, you will find his publications, ongoing projects, 
    and reflections on writing, research, and storytelling.
