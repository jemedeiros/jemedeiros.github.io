<h1>Short Summary</h1>

<p>Studies of European Archaeology (specialized in Prehistory), Philosophy, Physical and Cultural Anthropology and 
Computer Science at the University of Freiburg (2008-2012, 2013-2019), University of Texas at Austin (2012-2013) 
and PUC University Rio de Janeiro (2005-2007). I am specially interested in the historico-genetic theory of culture. </p>

<p> Presently, I work at the <a href="https://www.rz.uni-freiburg.de/rz/organisation/mitarbeiterinnen/medeiros?searchterm=Medeiros">
    Computer Center</a> of the University of Freiburg. 
    I am the Application Manager working at the Document Management System Project at the University, 
    whereby the university is introducing a new DMS to coordinate and centralize digital processes
    of the university administration.
    In my Post-Doctoral Role I maintained ties as a Researcher to the 
    Department of History of the <a href="http://dgp.cnpq.br/dgp/espelhogrupo/31604"> Universidade Federal Fluminense </a>.
    There I researched on the Daunian Stelae and ways to approach them from a cognitive perspective respecting
    the postulate of convergence of modern consciousness. 
    Learn more about my research, lectures, seminars, and talks in the
