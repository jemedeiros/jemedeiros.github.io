# New article
I just send to publication an article about how social stratification and cognitive approaches to archaeological interpretation differ in their methods, approach, structural presumptions and even in their concrete results in improving real knowledge about the past.

This more theoretical discussions is, however, used to look at the Stelae from Daunia of the Iron Age.

The article named "Hierarquia e Sentido" should come out soon. Another article in German, sent and accepted a couple of years ago should be coming out at the same time.
