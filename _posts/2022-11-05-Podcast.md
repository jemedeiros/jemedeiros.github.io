# Podcast Café Archäologie - new episodes and changes coming.
I am now preparing to reengage with Podcast Café Archäologie.

After losing my co-moderation and partner in crime for preparation, editing and postedition work, I am looking for ways to complement the archaeological part of the podcast with culinary themes. Maybe the best way is to find someone who would prepare something separatly and just add it to the introduction. Maybe someone to talk about wine or food in general.

What is certain is that I have now at least 3 new episodes coming with different guests. 

At least two of these episodes will be in English with international guests. 

Thus, in keeping with the internationalization of the program, I am also thinking about changing the title to something shorter.
The podcast might change hosting platform too, but I think I might find some kind solution with github-pages.
