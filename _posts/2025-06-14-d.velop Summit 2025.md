# Hochschultag & D.velop Summmit 2025

On June 3rd, I had the pleasure of representing the University of Freiburg, as well as the DMS working group of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, at the University Day of the DMS Network, where I gave the opening lecture. <!--more-->

I addressed some of the questions that motivate me in my work:

- In what legal and social contexts do the needs for introducing a document management system arise?
- What role does the open framework of meaning of "administration" play in the organization of our working world?
- How can information technology goals be translated into the management of complex projects?
- What must be considered when dealing with tasks full of dependencies and interactions?

The exchange was motivating. Many thanks to the organizing team at the North Rhine-Westphalia Competence Center, led by Doreen Schwarz and colleagues, and to d.velop for the professional event held as part of the d.velop summit!

This year, I had the impression that the universities and d.velop Public Sector were growing closer together. The cooperation is becoming more mature, clearer, and effective.

It was a nice, intensive university day, providing a lot of momentum for the next steps. ðŸš€
