# Hello World and welcome to a new feture: my blog. 
I am introducing a blog to my private website on github pages.

This blog will be used for reflection, to share interesting news or facts and to communicate new activities that I might be involved with.

I am now using jekyll and bundler and experimenting with the possibilities of deployment to githubpages.
