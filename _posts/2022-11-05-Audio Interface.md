# Audio Interface arrived.
After a time planning, I now have the audio interface to use with my microphone and to better record and edit the Podcast Episodes. 
At the same time I am also working on a new theme music, to use on some other projects.


I am thinking about making this jingle as a gift to the guitar player Mike Stern and wondering if he could make out of this simple a real composition.
It would also feel like a dream if Pat Metheny and himself would play this music. :-)


As you all should know, I compose the intros, outros and jingles for my programs. 
I am now thinking of composing one theme after the other and giving them out for free into the public domain.

Unless Mike Stern and Pat Metheny would really want to play this song. Then it would be Mike Sterns Copyright.
But these are only amateurishly dreams of grandeur.
