<h1>Ups and downs</h1>
<p>15 Jul 2024 - de Medeiros, J. E. M.</p>

<h1 id="embracing-the-ups-and-downs-of-skateboarding">Embracing the Ups and Downs of Skateboarding</h1>

<p>(Surf-)Skateboarding is a journey, not just a sport. Over the past few days, I’ve felt the exhilarating rush of progress. There were moments when everything clicked, and I believed I was finally getting the hang of it. My confidence soared as I executed movements with increasing ease, thinking I had finally conquered the learning curve. However, the last few days at the skatepark were a reminder that progress isn’t always linear.
<!--more--></p>

<h1 id="the-struggle-is-real">The Struggle is Real</h1>

<p>Despite my initial progress, during my last visit I found myself struggling with even the most basic movements. A couple of unexpected falls shook my confidence and made it harder to find the motivation to keep pushing forward. It was frustrating to feel like I was taking steps backward after feeling so good about my progress just days before.</p>

<h1 id="finding-motivation-in-the-simple-things">Finding Motivation in the Simple Things</h1>

<p>But this is the essence of skating. It’s not just about the tricks or the progress; it’s about the experience. As such experiences are idiosyncratic and meaning arises from and are conditioned the subjective conditions of the individual life. Even when I’m not making obvious progress, there’s something incredibly fulfilling about just being at the park. On warm summer days, there’s a certain magic in cruising around, feeling the wind against my face, and soaking in the sun. The skatepark is a place where I can forget about the setbacks, the everyday world and just enjoy the moment.</p>

<h1 id="the-joy-of-community">The Joy of Community</h1>

<p>One of the greatest joys is nonetheless the community. Hanging out with the homies, sharing tips, motivating each other, and laughing off the falls together makes every visit to the park worthwhile. The camaraderie and support of fellow skaters turn even the toughest days into memorable experiences.</p>

<h1 id="embracing-the-journey">Embracing the Journey</h1>

<p>Skateboarding is full of ups and downs. It’s easy to get discouraged when things get tough, but it’s important to remember why we started in the first place. For me, it’s about more than just learning tricks; it’s about the freedom, the joy, and the community. It’s about pushing myself, falling, getting back up, and enjoying every moment of the ride.</p>

<p>So, even when progress seems elusive, I’ll keep showing up at the skatepark. I’ll cruise, I’ll fall, and I’ll get back up. Because at the end of the day, it’s not just about the destination — it’s about the journey.</p>

<h3 id="brief-summary-of-characters">Brief summary of characters:</h3>
<p>As I delve into these skateboarding and surfskate stories, I find myself walking a fine line between revealing too much and protecting the identities of those involved — especially minors or individuals who prefer to remain out of the public eye. Allow me, my imaginary reader, to introduce you to the key characters in this thrilling narrative:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Senpais</strong>: These are the seasoned skaters, the ones who’ve mastered the art of gliding across concrete waves. I’ve affectionately dubbed them “Senpais.” When multiple Senpais appear in a story, I’ll distinguish them as Senpai1, Senpai2, and so forth.</li>
  <li><strong>Sensei</strong>: Picture a skater with skills that transcend the ordinary. This individual isn’t just a Senpai; they’re a Sensei. Their wisdom, advice, and teachings elevate the entire skating experience. They’re the ones who can turn a simple kickturn into poetry in motion.</li>
  <li><strong>Senpai-Sensei</strong>: Now, this character is a delightful blend of both Senpai and Sensei. They possess the skills of a seasoned skater but also offer valuable guidance to others. Think of them as the bridge between experience and mentorship.
Remember, these characters aren’t just names — they’re the heartbeat of my skateboarding experiences. As we ride through twists, turns, and gravity-defying tricks, keep an eye out for their distinctive styles and personalities. These are real people.</li>
</ol>
