<h1>Back to work surprise</h1>
<p>06 May 2024 - de Medeiros, J. E. M.</p>

<h1 id="back-to-work">Back to work</h1>
<p>Today, duty called …back. After a really nice week on vacation, work started. I went to my office where I can work better anyway. Before work, I got my dose of dopamine by going to the sauna. Now, as part of my everyday life, I need sport, fitness or sauna to boost my dopamine levels before heading to work. The initial light sadness of returning to obligations and the prospect of dealing with work-related troubles (to literally shoot) soon gave way to a more pragmatic neutrality of feelings, mixed with the sincere joy of meeting with colleagues.

<h2 id="the-surprise">The surprise</h2>

<p>By midday, a strong desire to eat a burger awakened in me, and I asked a good friend to join me. However, he did not respond. The traditional and ordinary work canteen became the alternative. I ate and returned to my meetings. After the meeting, I discovered that the servers were experiencing problems. Yes, you guessed it — I had to troubleshoot. As the process of finding a solution can be time-consuming and mentally exhausting, I often check my emails while waiting for processes to restart or servers to reboot. During this routine, I received the most unexpected email ever. The Boardshop in Freiburg had received the parts needed to repair my Surfskate. It was now in good condition and ready to go. Unfortunately, I couldn’t leave my job on time to visit the boardshop before they closed. Thankfully, my wife stepped in and picked up the surfskate. This unexpected news was the best way to start my first day back to everyday work.</p>

<p>Thank you Boardshop and thank you Skateboarding. Whenever I lose myself Skates help me remember who I am and what my life really means.</p>
