                    The scientific discovery of the past is not usually associated with great numbers of people.
                    Some people would understand it even as an elitist activity. Yet, there are a number of people looking
                    for reliques of the past in their free time. In this context, there is an ongoing discussion about how to deal with amateur archaeologists
                    specially those using metal detectors. It used to be problematic to gather data about these activities. Consequently the discussions about the role played by amatuers
                    and metal detectorists lacked precise data. However, the British Museum had an innovative idea that offered numbers to the work
                    with amateur archaeologists. Other countries now followed and started their own projects. I want to compare them here. <span id="dots">...</span>

                    A lot of these finding do not appear in the scientific radar of professional or academic archaeology.
                    However, the internet has made possible to harness some of the potentially lost information.
                    The <i>Portable Antiquities Scheme</i> (a.k.a <abbr>PAS</abbr>) is a public programme for the voluntary registration of archaeological finds made by the public
                    in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
                    It uses this capacity to crowdsource information in the network of computers to support and
                    orient hobby archeologists and cautiously safeguard information that would otherwise remain unregistered.
                    In addition to community and educational work, PAS provides a database for research.
                    PAS is, above all, a pedagogical program, making available a database and information on how to deal with archaeological finds.
                    While this is an intelligent strategy, it is certainly not free from discussions.
                    You can read more about this subject in their website (e.g. the <a href="https://finds.org.uk/publications/reports/2017">Annual Reports</a>)

                    Nowadays the Netherlands started their own program called the <a href="https://portable-antiquities.nl/pan/#/public">
                        Portable Antiquities of the Netherlands
                    </a>
                    (a.k.a <abbr>PAN</abbr>). Now, Danemark too with the <a href="https://www.metaldetektorfund.dk/"> DIME </a>.
                    And Finnland <a href="https://blogs.helsinki.fi/sualt-project/"> SuALT / Find Sampo </a>

                <p>
                    While I am waiting to see what happens with all these projects and much more to come, I thought about buiding
                    a program that would gahter their data, respecting any copyright and sensitive data they do not wish to publish,
                    and display them side by side so that we can get an idea of the comparison between their projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just started with the data from the PAS website. And I am going to start with some data for the Late bronze Age and the Early Iron Age,
                    because that is the data I worked with in my M.A. Thesis. Naturally, I want to make relevant comparisons and, thus, display here how the projects
                    are doing in regard to their own regions, and in regard to the archaeological potentials in their regions.
                    But the idea is to compare with data from the other projects too, once I get all the proportions from each project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project just stared, so please be patient. But you will find here, distribution and density maps, and a summary of the data
                    I am retrieving for their websites in real time. I only deal with data open to the public, so as a rule the finds will not be pointing to their exact locations
                </p>
                <p> Also, the maps take a while to load, specially with firefox. So please be patient. </p> </span>
